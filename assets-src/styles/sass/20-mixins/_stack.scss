\*------------------------------------*/

/**
This mixin allows us to add vertical spacing between a container's direct children,
much like the 'axiomatic owl' technique but limited to specific use cases.

By applying Flexbox to the parent container, we can use auto margin on a specific
child element. This way, we can choose to group elements inside the stack to the
top/bottom of the vertical space, which is useful for card-like components.

Use with a specific measure, or without for the default measure, e.g.

main {
	@include stack(4rem);
}

article {
	@include stack;
}
 */

@mixin stack($measure: 1em) {
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	justify-content: flex-start;

	& > * + * {
		margin-top: $measure;
	}
}
